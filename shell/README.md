## shell tools

I use and love:

-   [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
    -   an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration
-   [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
    -   fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder
-   [Zsh-z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z)
    -   command line tool that allows you to jump quickly to directories that you have visited frequently in the past, or recently -- but most often a combination of the two (a concept known as "frecency").
-   [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker)
    -   A simple terminal UI for both docker and docker-compose
-   [ripgrep (rg)](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
    -   search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern
