# tk-boilerplate/editorconfig

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is a file format that tells your IDE how to format the files in your project. No more inconsistent line breaks, indentations etc. caused by different team members.

## I use them all: ESlint, prettier and editorconfig

... read in [../prettier/README.md](../prettier/README.md)

## Usage

-   Copy the `.editorconfig` of this folder in the root of your project
-   Maybe you need an Plugin for your IDE, or prettier handles it for you
