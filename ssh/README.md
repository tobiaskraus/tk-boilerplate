## ssh key with passphrase: SSO for SSH keys

I use a passphrase on my ssh key. This is great for security (simply stealing my private key file will not give any access), but it comes with a downside:

-   Everytime I verify myself via ssh (e.g. I push changes via `git push`) I am forced to type in my passphrase again.
-   VSCode does not expect a command prompt which asks for my passphrase when I use their integrated git features to push my code and therefore fails (I guess there are problems with other programs which use ssh in the background as well).

### solution: with Apple Keychain

Add the following lines to `~/.ssh/config`:

```sh
Host *
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa with the path to your private key if itâ€™s different.

To confirm that your key is loaded in the agent, run:

```sh
ssh-add -l
```

### old solution on my Windows (before I used Apple Keychain)

Add this to your `.profile` file in your user folder:

```sh
# ssh-agent on Git (to save ssh passphrase during session)
alias sshp='eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add'
```

In a new terminal window run `sshp` once. Only the first time of your OS session, you will be asked to type in your passphrase.

For VSCode users: after the terminal session is signed on via `sshp` run `vscode .` to open this folder in VSCode and the VSCode process will be signed on as well.
