# tk-boilerplate

Some boilerplate stuff, which I need frequently to get my projects running smooth.

## Table of content

- [prettier/](prettier/README.md)
  - explanation how to setup and why
  - `.prettierrc` file
- [vscode/](vscode/README.md)
  - VSCode snippets to type less code

## Why is this public?

Many things are really subjective. They work best for me - and not necessary best for you.
But I don't want to hide these things, as some stuff might help others as well.
At work I already got asked if I can share some settings.
And the easiest to do so, is to just put them Open Source.
